## Introduction

The purpose of this script is to tidy and quality control the covariates for our RR analysis

Covariates: Age, BMI, race/ethnicity, family income, site (for not imaging models), scanner_id (for imaging models), parental current mood, population weighting variable, family id. 

This data frame was downloaded from Release 4.0 and the DEAP portal which works off the ABCD data release (3.0) for the BMI and income variables. 

## Setup

Load libraries, set working directory.

```{r, setup}

library(psych)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(readr)
library(gridExtra)

setwd("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/users/niamh/puberty_ABCD/ABCD_puberty_depression/prep")
getwd()

```

##LOAD DATA

Note: Renaming variables to make the names more intuitive. 

Need to insert table here of all the covariates used.... 

```{r, covariate table}

vars <- factor(c("src_subject_id", "eventname", "sex", "age_years", "bmi", "race.6level", "demo_comb_income_p",  "abcd_site", "high.educ", "fsqc_qu_motion", "asr_scr_depress_r", "rel_family_id"))

var_lables <- factor(c("Participant ID", "Data collection wave", "Sex at birth", "Age in years", "Body Mass Index", "Race (6-level categorisation", "Household income", "Study site", "Highest education of parents", "FreeSurfer QC motion", "Parent (self-report) depressive problems", "Family ID"))

```

Note: While we are primarily using Release 4.0, we will use some covariates (race.6.level, BMI) from DEAP (still using Release 3.0) as these variables have been derived by DEAP and are not available on the NDA site. There have been no updates/no changes on these variables between release 3.0 and 4.0. Additionally, for our covariates, we are using baseline and year 1 data (all available in 3.0), so are confident that this won't impact our analyses. 


```{r, load data}
#import site info from longitudinal tracking file
site <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/Culture_and_Environment/abcd_lt01.rds")

#import family ID to track family and population stratification weight
family <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/Culture_and_Environment/acspsw03.rds")

#note: DEAP is still waiting to be updated to release4.0.
covs <-rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/users/niamh/ABCD_release3.0/iii.data/DEAP_data_downloads/covs_puberty_RR.rds") 

#parent mental health data
parent_mh <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/Mental_Health/abcd_asrs01.rds")

#household income info
demo <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/Mental_Health/pdem02.rds")

#import dti for additional DTI motion covariates
dti <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/MRI_T_roi/abcd_dti_p101.rds")

#import MRI info for scanner manufacturer ID
mri_info <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/data/abcd/release4.0/iii.data/MRI_T_roi/abcd_mri01.rds")

#import cleaned cortical measures to get WBV
cortical <- rio::import("/Volumes/GenScotDepression/users/niamh/puberty_ABCD/ABCD_puberty_depression/data/cortical_year2_R4.0.rds")

```

#rename variables so consistent across scripts and more intuitive

#extract bmi and race from covs df

#extract site id (this give site for each event name) and subject id 
site <- site %>%

#extract family id, acs stratification weight 
family <- family %>% 
  select(src_subject_id, eventname, sex, rel_family_id, interview_date, acs_raked_propensity_score)

#extract household income (note: income also available in covs df but var extracted here is more detailed, i.e., has more levels)

cortical$eventname <- "2_year_follow_up_y_arm_1"

#extract WBV, ICV 
WBV <- cortical %>%

```
Let's explore family ID structure 

```{r, family ID}

family_id_tbl <- family %>%
  group_by(eventname) %>% 
  summarise(no_rows = length(family))
print(family_id_tbl)

```

##Extra info on income variable. 

Income data is only available at baseline 

Income level descriptions:

1= Less than $5,000; 2=$5,000 through $11,999; 3=$12,000 through $15,999; 4=$16,000 through $24,999; 5=$25,000 through $34,999; 6=$35,000 through $49,999; 7=$50,000 through $74,999; 8= $75,000 through $99,999; 9=$100,000 through $199,999; 10=$200,000 and greater. 999 = Don't know ; 777 = Refuse to answer

##MAIN ANALYSIS (full model)

```{r, check covs dataframe}

colnames(covs_main)
summary(covs_main)

```
Hypothesis 1 (no imaging data)

Basic Model : Age, race, family, site 

Full model: age, race, family, site + BMI + income + parental mood  + population weight. 

All covariates are from baseline expect for parental mood, which is taken from year 2. Although our outcome measure is youth depression at Year 3, there was no parental mood available from year 3 in release 4.0. 

See PREP_imputation script for exploration and imputation of missing data
